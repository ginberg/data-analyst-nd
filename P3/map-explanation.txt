Map explanation

I have chose the city of Utrecht in the Netherlands because I live there.
The data was not yet on mapzen metro-extracts, but I did a request and they added it, so now it is available. Please see
https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts

The exact coordinates that are used are below
"utrecht_netherlands": {
+                    "bbox": {
+                        "top": "52.184",
+                        "left": "4.933",
+                        "bottom": "52.001",
+                        "right": "5.303"
+                    }
+                },
