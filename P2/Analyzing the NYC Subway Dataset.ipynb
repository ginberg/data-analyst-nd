    "The purpose of this project is to find out if more people use the subway when it is raining. Fortunately, there is a column rain that indicates if it was raining at a certain time and location. According to the documentation it is an indicator (0 or 1). \n",
    "How to measure if the subway is used more? Well, the data contains the number of entries at some units where a unit is a data collector of multiple turnstiles. ENTRIESn is the reading of cummulative turnstile entries from the remote unit and ENTRIESn_hourly indicates the difference in ENTRIES from the previous REGULAR reading. It seems like ENTRIESn_hourly is a good measure of how many people will use the subway.\n",

    "However, the data from our sample is not normally distributed if we look at the plot below. Mann–Whitney´s U test is a nonparametrict test that can be used if we don't assume that the data follows a certain distribution. Because we don´ t assume any underlying distribution this test will be used. The test will be one tailed, because it is only interesting to know if **more** people use the subway when it is raining. The p critical value is 0.05, since this is quite common.\n",

    "#### Do more people ride the NYC subway when it is raining or when it is not raining?\n",
    "\n",
    "From the results obtained from the statistical test and lineair regression, we can say in general that more people ride the NYC subway when it is raining. However, rain is not a very good predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the statistical test, the conclusion is that our sample supports the alternative hypothesis, the population mean for rain is greater that for non rain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our lineair regression model, the influence of the rain on the ouput is negative. I have also tried to leave out the feature rain and it almost didn't change the R2 value. The purpose of the regression model is to be able to predict the outcome based on certain features. However, these features influence each other. If one is left out, it will change the param values of the other features. The dummy variable UNIT has a big influence on R2. This leads to the conclusion that UNIT is a good predictor, but rain isn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Shortcomings\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some shortcomings in my analysis.\n",
    "* dataset: the dataset contains a lot more rows for non-rain than for rain. It would be ideal to have equal number of rows for both cases.\n",
    "* regression model: the chosen regression model OLS (ordinary least squares) is quite simplistic and has some drawbacks. It is sensitive for outliers and as seen in the figure of entries per hour, there are some outliers. Next to this, OLS performs bad when features are put into the model, that have a dependence between them. \n",
