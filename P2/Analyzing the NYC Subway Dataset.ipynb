    "The purpose of this project is to find out if more people use the subway when it is raining. Fortunately, there is a column rain that indicates if it was raining at a certain time and location. According to the documentation it is an indicator (0 or 1). \n",
    "How to measure if the subway is used more? Well, the data contains the number of entries at some units where a unit is a data collector of multiple turnstiles. ENTRIESn is the reading of cummulative turnstile entries from the remote unit and ENTRIESn_hourly indicates the difference in ENTRIES from the previous REGULAR reading. It seems like ENTRIESn_hourly is a good measure of how many people will use the subway.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the independent variable is the rain. It can either be a 0 (no rain) or 1 (rain)\n",

    "Ha : μR > μN\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing means of populations, multiple tests can be used. A t-test or z-test can be used if the data is assumed to be normally distributed. \n",
    "However, the data from our sample is not normally distributed if we look at the plot below. Mann–Whitney´s U test is a nonparametrict test that can be used if we don't assume that the data follows a certain distribution. Because we don´ t assume any underlying distribution this test will be used. The test will be one tailed, because it is only interesting to know if **more** people use the subway when it is raining. The p critical value is 0.05, since this is quite common.\n",
