<h1>Identify Fraud from Enron Email</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. 
In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails 
and detailed financial data for top executives. Based on this data, I have identified persons that have caused this scandal, the people are referred to as people 
of interest (poi).</p>
<p>To identify a poi, I haved used machine learning algorithms. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) 
that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Because the enron dataset already contains if a person is 
a poi, I will use supervised algorithms. The idea of such an algorithm is the find the underlying patterns that determine the outcome feature (poi). 
Furthermore, the algorithm to use will be a classifier, because the output feature has only 2 possible outcomes, True or False.</p>
<h2>Dataset exploration and cleaning</h2>
<p>First, I have explored the dataset. Because the input file is in a format that is hard to read, I have transformed it to a csv file.</p>
<p>TODO: outliers
TODO:exploration</p>
<h2>Feature selection</h2>
<p>I have used SelectKBest to select the best features from the input features. The input features are the features that were supplied from the dataset plus 1 have added. 
My ideal behind this feature is, that a poi might be given a relatively high bonus compared to others. That is why I have added a bonus to salary feature.</p>
<h2>Algorithm</h2>
<p>I have tried multiple classifiers to see the effect on the accuracy. </p>
<p>So, for the final I have used a DecisionTreeClassifier.</p>
<h2>Algorithm tuning</h2>
<p>With algorithm tuning a better performance can be made.
I have used GridSearchCV to tune my algorithm.</p>
<h2>Validation strategy</h2>
<p>StratifiedShuffleSplit</p>
<h2>Evaluation metrics</h2>
<p>Accuracy/ Precision/ Recall</p>
